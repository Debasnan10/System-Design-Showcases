## Contributing to System Design Showcases

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repo aims to be a practical, well-structured collection of system design patterns and reference architectures. Contributions can be new design documents, improved diagrams, corrections, or clarifications.

Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your change (e.g., `feat/rag-diagram-improvement`).
- Keep each PR focused: one feature or one document improvement per PR.
- Use Markdown for design docs. Add images to the `diagrams/` folder or `designs/assets/` and reference them with relative paths.
- Include a short summary at the top of any design file with: intent, target audience, and key trade-offs.
- For diagrams, prefer vector formats (SVG) and include an exported PNG fallback for quick previews.
- Follow existing style and structure: Summary, Components, Data Flow, Trade-offs, Operational Concerns, References.

Review process

- PRs will be reviewed for clarity, accuracy, and structure. Expect feedback and be ready to iterate.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR. If you’re a frequent contributor, request to be added as a collaborator.

Thank you for helping make this collection better!
