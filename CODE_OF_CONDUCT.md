# Code of Conduct

All contributors, maintainers, and visitors are expected to follow a simple code of conduct based on respect and inclusion.

Be respectful. Focus critiques on content, not the person. Avoid abusive, harassing, or discriminatory language.

If you encounter behavior that violates this code, please open an issue or contact the repository owner privately.

We aim to maintain a welcoming space for people of all backgrounds and skill levels.
