# System Design Showcases

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-designs%2FREADME.md-blue)](designs/README.md) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Debasnan10/System-Design-Showcases)](https://github.com/Debasnan10/System-Design-Showcases/issues)

A curated, practical collection of system-design patterns, architecture blueprints, and implementation notes for building reliable, scalable distributed systems. This repository is aimed at software engineers, architects, and technical interview candidates who want clear, example-driven explanations of design choices and trade-offs.

## What you'll find here

- Concise design write-ups with diagrams and trade-offs.
- Reference architectures for microservices, CQRS, event-driven systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Practical notes on reliability, observability, cost controls, and deployment patterns.
- A diagrams folder where exported SVG/PNG assets live.

## Quick start

1. Browse the designs in the `designs/` folder. Start with `designs/README.md` which lists all documents and the suggested reading order.
2. Open any design (for example `designs/microservice-patterns.md`) to see a summary, architecture diagram, components, data flow, and trade-offs.
3. Contribute: follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and open a PR with your design or improvements.

## Featured designs

- `designs/microservice-patterns.md` — Core microservice patterns (CQRS, Sagas, Event Sourcing, idempotency).
- `designs/rag-system.md` — Retrieval-Augmented Generation system architecture and operational concerns.

## How to use these docs

- Read the summaries first to decide what to deep-dive into.
- Look at the "Trade-offs" sections to understand alternatives and constraints.
- Use diagrams alongside the markdown to get both the conceptual and implementation views.
